# algorithms_js_rs_cpp

The problems come from Stephen Grider's Udemy course
[The Coding Inteview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/).

To run tests:

```sh
npx jest anagrams/test.js --watch
```

Or, use the `run.sh` script:

```sh
./run.sh anagrams
```

## These execises are here only for review.

All problems will have a javascript solution.
Most will have C++ and Rust solutions as I make my way through each problem.
I will eventually try to solve every problem with Rust and C++ also.

These solutions will only match the courses solutions if I just happen to solve the
problems in the same manner. If I show the course solutions, then I'll mark it.

I have been mostly studying Rust these past several months, so the naming conventions 
may favor Rust's style. I will try to keep the naming conventions the same in each 
language.
